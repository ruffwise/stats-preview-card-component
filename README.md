## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using examples from the solution area, I learned how to use the css property of "mix-blend-mode", I also learned how to use the "opacity"
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
{
mix-blend-mode: multiply;
 opacity: 80%;
}
 ```


### Continued development

I will continue focusing on mastering HTML and CSS, afterwards proceed to javascript
